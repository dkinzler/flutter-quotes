//TODO explain this better, is this actually necessary, it wasn't below for HomeScreen
//maybe only if we use page builders instead of widget builders?
/*
Note for page builders:
  Whenever we create a some page that takes parameters, we should provide a key that is different
  for different parameters. Because otherwise when the new page is pusehd, the page widget isn't actually rebuild.
  Because without a key, flutter doesn't rebuild the widget when the type of widget is the same.
  E.g. we have path '/somepath' with builder 
    (context, state) {
      var x = state.queryParams['xyz'];
      return SomePage(x: x);
    }
  if we are already on SomePage with x='somestring' 
  and then push SomePage with x='someotherstring', the ui won't actually update

AppRouter could implement ChangeNotifier and internally listen to _router or _routerDelegate
